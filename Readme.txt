#############################

A small project of "Internet Technologies" course (code 10310), during my Software Engineering B.Sc. at Afeka Academic College of Engineering, Tel Aviv, Israel.

The goal was to create a PHP user interface, which will give the user an option to create "his favorite places" small HTML website.
First you will choose how many destinations do you want, and then in each destination you'll insert the title, cover picture, and places you visited there.
In each place you were, you insert the place title, place image, and a small description.
At the end of the process, a small HTML website will be created using PHP server-side, which will display all the destinations the user inserted.

Folder A - The original website:
The website that was first built with HTML alone, and the goal was to create a user interface using PHP that will create the same website

Folder B - Resources:
The pictures and resources used in this project

Folder C - The PHP server-side files:
The PHP server-side files which contains both user interface, and the files used to create the output HTML

Folder D - The result:
The small HTML website which is the output of folder C
